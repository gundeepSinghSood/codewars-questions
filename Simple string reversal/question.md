## Question

#### In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.\

##### For example:

```javascript
solve("our code") = "edo cruo"
-- Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo".
-- However, there is a space after the first three characters, hence "edo cruo"

solve("your code rocks") = "skco redo cruoy"
solve("codewars") = "srawedoc"
```

##### More examples:

⋅⋅* solve("codewars"),"srawedoc"
⋅⋅* solve("your code"),"edoc ruoy"
⋅⋅* solve("your code rocks"),"skco redo cruoy"
⋅⋅* solve("i love codewars"),"s rawe docevoli"
